# Project Euler in R

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about) is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

I have attempted several of the Project Euler problems. The solution and time are shown at the top of the script. If you have any questions or advice, please feel free to contact me. benjamin.phillips22@gmail.com
